        This is a program that introduces us to data Structures and Algorithms.
        
        DATA STRUCTURES
        A Data structure is a way to store multiple values in a single structure. 
        Data structures are categorised as:
        
        1. Linear
            - Array
            - List
            - Stack
            - Queues
        2. Non-Linear
            - Tree
            - Graph
       
       ALGORITHM
       An algorithm is a method that is used to perform a specific task. Although there might
       be many different ways to perform a specific task, the most important algorithm is one
       that keeps in mind both:
            - Time Complexity
            - Space Complexity.
